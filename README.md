# Discover RStats

This is **Discovering Statistics using R**, a university elective course that is offered by the [department of Statistics](https://www.squ.edu.om/science/Departments/Statistics) at [Sultan Qaboos university](www.squ.edu.om).  

Nowadays, data is everywhere and we are hungry of information! Statistics is all about making sense of data and figuring out how to put that information to use.   In this course, you will learn how to use R;  an open-source statistical tool for data analytics and visualisation. You will learn basic exploratory data analysis including descriptive statistics, data visualization and basic inferential statistics.  

The page is created using [LearnR](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) package to ease learning R to students from different background in the course.

## Welcome

This is RStat2100, the R laboratory materials for the course STAT2100: Discovering Statistics using R. The course is offered by the department of Statistics at <a href="https://www.squ.edu.om" target="_blank">Sultan Qaboos university</a>. R is a popular choice in data analytics for statistical computing and graphics that is widely used in sciences and social sciences. RStat2100 introduces the R software environment, descriptive statistics, graphical exploration of data and basic inferential statistic such as analysis of relationships among variables using correlation and regression basic concepts.

If this is the first time you hear about R, the following short video created by R Consortium provides an overview about the program, its applications and what is used for.

## Install RStudio

In RStat2101, you are going to work with a user-friendly R interface called RStudio. It is an integrated development environment (IDE) for working with R. It is easy for writing scripts and has practical features for data analysis and visualizations. Check out Rstudio website to take a tour of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/" target="_blank">RStudio's IDE</a>.

RStudio Desktop version is available in the Statistics Department computer laboratories, where RStat2101 sessions are run. However, if you are interested to install it on your personal computer, you need to install R first and then Rstudio.

-   To download and install R, click <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank">here</a>
-   To download and install RStudio, click <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank">here</a>

![](images/rstudioWelc.png){style="float: right; width: 200px; height: 200px;  "} For help installing R and RStudio, follow the installation instructions for <a href="https://rpubs.com/ImanAlhasani/RInstallationforWindows" target="_blank">Windows</a> users and <a href="https://rpubs.com/ImanAlhasani/RInstallationforMac" target="_blank">Mac</a> users (courtesy of Afra Al Manei, Department of Statistics, SQU). You can also sign up in <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/" target="_blank">RStudio Cloud</a> and use the online version of the program. Also, RStudio is available in Anaconda Navigator. However, R packages are not included in the default base environment and hence an R environment has to be created to run Rstudio. For help, see this <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/navigator/tutorials/create-r-environment/" target="_blank">Anaconda Documentation</a>.

## Get Started

To use RStudio, you type code in it and ask the device to interpret them and act on their instructions. For some of you, this could be the first time you are coding, but do not worry! The course does not require to have any background in computer programming! Here, we will walk you through each of the steps required to begin using Rstudio.

Let us start your first R code! The following box is an empty code chunk provided to write and run code. For example, write `print("Welcome to R!")` and then click `Run Code`. The output will be shown below the chunk.

```{r welcome, exercise=TRUE}
```
